## Breast Cancer Prediction — Using Machine Learning                                                              
●	There are two types of breast tumours found in humans: Benign (non-cancerous) tumors and Malignant (cancerous) tumors. Through different Machine Learning algorithms, we try to classify the tumor whether it is cancerous or not and find the most accurate one.
● We have various algorithm to measure performance of the model with its Accuracy Score and we have used below algorithms for predictions:
1) Logistic Regression
2) Decision Tree Classifier
3) K- Nearest Neighbor Classifier
4) Naive Bayes
